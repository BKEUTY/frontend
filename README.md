# Frontend Workspace

## Structure

- **app/web**: The ReactJS web application (formerly the root project).
- **app/mobile**: The React Native Expo mobile application.

## Mobile App Configuration

The mobile app has been initialized with Expo and configured with a structure similar to the web app:
- `src/Assets`: Copied from Web.
- `src/constants/Theme.js`: Contains colors and fonts extracted from Web's `global.css`.
- `src/Component`: Placeholder for components.
- `src/Context`: Placeholder for contexts.
